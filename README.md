1. Explain your procedure to us.
    I begin by identifying elements and styles that are similar throughout all of the pages on my website, and then I try to determine which class I should assign when creating my HTML file. in order for me to style those pages without having to travel back and forth later.

2. The difficulties you encountered while developing.
    I believe that throughout the process, I have not been sufficiently organised. For instance, I had to constantly returning to the HTML pages to alter the structure or sequence in order to get the desired style because I did not think the structure was good enough when I typed my HTML.

3. How did you get through those changes? 
    I make an effort to keep a notebook at my side so I can write down the class and general framework I need. However, I believe that going forward, I should plan more thoroughly before beginning any HTML work.

4. What knowledge have you gained from building your online portfolio?
    In order for me to become a better developers, I must structure my work to my liking. My work will go more smoothly in this situation. But I do enjoy a lot during the process!
